# The scripts Repository

This repository is comprised of mostly single file, quick running scripts that can be used to<br>
automate your common computer task. Languages used in this repository are: Python, bash and sh. More<br>
languages may be added in the future. Although this is mostly single file, there are a few instances<br>
where calling a python script from a bash script is required, this is not a problem for this<br>
repository sould that be needed.

## Contributing

I am still rather new to Git and GitHub. I have contrubuted but am weak on processing pull requests.<br>
All are welcome to contribute but I do ask that you clone this repository and work on a personal<br>
branch, then push that branch to GitHub. I'll do my best to process your changes. I'm sure I'll lose<br>
a few but I think together we can figure it out. This should be a step up from the first time<br>
contributers repositoreis that we all learned on, as the idea is to have actual code and scritps<br>
that need work. Thank you for your participation and patients.
